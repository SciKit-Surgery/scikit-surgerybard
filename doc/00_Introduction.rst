Workshop: Basic Augmented Reality Demo
===============================================

This is the Basic Augmented Reality Demo. It is forms the basis of a week long 
workshop on surgical augmented reality as part of the Centre for Medical Image Computing's
`Medical Imaging Summer School`_. It can also be used on its own. The demo is a module of 
Python libraries and applications, built using `OpenCV`_, `VTK`_, and the  `SNAPPY`_ libraries.

Aims: 
The workshop aims to introduce students to some key concepts used in image guided surgery.

Outcomes:
After completing the workshop the student should be able to:
- Calibrate a video camera using a standard chessboard pattern.
- Calibrate a tracked pointer using an invariant point method.
- Register a CT model of a pelvic phantom to physical space using
  fiducial markers.
- Explain how rigid body transforms between different coordinate systems are
  combined to create a basic augmented reality system.
- Explain the difference between calibration residual error, fiducial registration 
  error, and target registration error.
- Combine the above to create a augmented reality demonstration using the supplied phantom.
